WP Facebook Like makes it easy to integrate the Facebook Like button. 
Choose to automatically append the button before or after the content, 
or use a template tag to place the button where ever you want.

The button will automatically be inserted after the post, but if you 
want the button to appear before the post, change the color or make 
the plugin only show the button and no faces, make those changes in the 
settings panel.

To see all available settings, have a look at the options screenshot.

To manually include the Like button in a post or page, set the plugin to 
disabled in the settings and include the [ wpfblike ] tag within the post.

Note that WP Facebook Like currently only supports PHP5.

= Template developers =

If you are a template developer, you may include the button where ever you 
want, as long as you stay within the WordPress loop. Just call the wpfblike()
function and echo the output to the correct place for your theme.

You can optionally pass arguments to the function if you want different
settings for default button. To get a default button, write the following:

<?php echo wpfblike(); ?>

To get a button with the count layout:

<?php echo wpfblike('layout=button_count'); ?>

You may concatenate multiple options as such:

<?php echo wpfblike('layout=button_count&colorscheme=dark&action=recommend'); ?>

The following options and values are currently recognized:

* layout (default, button_count)
* show_faces (true/false)
* colorscheme (light/dark/evil)
* width (in pixels)
* action (like/recommend)
* fbsend (true/false)

Refer to the options page for the plugin for a description of all options.
